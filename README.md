# BVEX_command
The is the very initial build of the BVEX commanding tool. Require further integration with the UDP server for it to be function. Currently, it simply translates a typed command on the CLI to some values specified in a list.

Add more commands as needed, and update the list on EVERY .h file. The ground computer must have the same list as the flight computers.

Built upon existing code from the BVEX project.
